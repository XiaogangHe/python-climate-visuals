    "Each of you has been randomly assigned a city in Southeast Asia (see Figure below) according to your student ID. For this project, you only need to work on the city assigned to you. Simulated near-surface air temperature (tas, unit: K) from the latest climate models have been provided (available [here](https://github.com/XiaogangHe/python-climate-visuals/tree/master/assets/data/finalproject), you can load the data directly without downloading using the example provided below). This data have been divided into two parts: historical (1850.01.01-2014.12.31) simulations (`CityName_hist.csv`) and future (2015.01.01-2099.12.31) projections (`CityName_future.csv`). Historical data contains 12 climate models and 60265 time steps. Future data contains 12 climate models and 31046 time steps in 2 climate scenarios (ssp245: sustainable development scenario; ssp585: fossil-fuel based development; check SSP details [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change)).
