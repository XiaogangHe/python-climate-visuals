    "Each of you has been randomly assigned a city in Southeast Asia (see Figure below) according to your student ID. For this project, you only need to work on the city that we assigned to you. Simulated near-surface air temperature (tas, unit: K) and near-surface specific humidity (huss, unit: 1) from the latest climate models have been provided (available [here](https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/2022.nus.ce3201-finalproject)). This data have been divided into two parts: historical (1850.01.01-2014.12.31) simulations (`CityName_hist.csv`) and future (2015.01.01-2099.12.31)  projections (`CityName_future.csv`). Historical data contains 12 climate models and 60265 time steps. However, future data contains 12 climate models, 2 climate scenarios (ssp245: sustainable development scenario; ssp585: fossil-fuel based development; check SSP details [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change)), and 31046 time steps. Please check the [Pandas tutorial](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals/chapters/data-analytics/pandas-basic.html#input-output-of-datal) for more details on how to read the `.csv` file."
