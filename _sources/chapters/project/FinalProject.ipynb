    "Each of you has been randomly assigned a city in Southeast Asia (see Figure below) according to your student ID. For this project, you only need to work on the city that we assigned to you. Simulated daily temperature (unit: K) from the latest climate models have been provided (available [here](https://hydrology.princeton.edu/data/hexg/CE3201_final_project_data/)). This data have been divided into two parts: historical (1850.01.01-2014.12.31) simulations (`studentID_historical.nc`) and future (2015.01.01-2100.12.31)  projections (`studentID_future.nc`). Please note that these two files have different dimensions. Historical data is a 2-D array with 10 climate models and 60265 time steps. However, future data is a 3-D array with 10 climate models, 2 climate scenarios (ssp126: sustainable development scenario; ssp585: fossil-fuel based development; check SSP details [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change)), and 31411 time steps. Please check the [Xarray tutorial](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals/chapters/data-analytics/xarray-basic.html#read-from-url) for more details (e.g., how to read the data directly from the URL)."
