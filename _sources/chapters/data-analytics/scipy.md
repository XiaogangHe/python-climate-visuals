SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.

```{admonition} SciPy capabilities
* **FUNDAMENTAL ALGORITHMS**: Algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
* **BROADLY APPLICABLE**: The algorithms and data structures provided by SciPy are broadly applicable across domains.
* **FOUNDATIONAL**: SciPy provides additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures.
* **PERFORMANT**: Wrapping highly-optimized implementations written in low-level languages like Fortran, C and C++ makes users enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
* **EASY TO USE**: SciPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
* **OPEN SOURCE**: Distributed under a liberal [BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), SciPy is developed and maintained 
   [publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse [community](https://scipy.org/community).
