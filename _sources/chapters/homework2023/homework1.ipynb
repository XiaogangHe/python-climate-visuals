Fit 2 GEV distributions of seasonal maximum rainfall deficit for each season using first 20 years and last 20 years separately. To do this, estimate the GEV parameters using (i) Maximum Likelihood and (ii) L-Moments, respectively. Based on your results. (Details on fitting a GEV distribution can be found in the [Scipy tutorial](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals/chapters/data-analytics/scipy-basic.html)).
