    ":::{note} It is not common to use `for-else` loops. `else` here means that the following algorithms will be run when the `for` loop ends. Normally, if we want to run specific algorithms after loops, we just need to script them after loops. However, if `break` exists in the loop, the algorithms in `else` will not execute when `break` happens, because the loop do not reach its end. Thus, `for-else` loops is useful only when there exists `break` statements within loops.\n",
